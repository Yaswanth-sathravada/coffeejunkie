      Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
      bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
      primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the
      world market for hot drinks.[2] The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are
      separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted
      and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before
      being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot,
      although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and
      presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte,
      or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and
      cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
      Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
      closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible
      evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day
      Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi
      shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
      similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[3] The coffee beans were
      procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
      intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink
      had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading
      to Europe.
